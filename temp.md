❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum (){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to return the sum of `a` and `b` without `a` and `b` being defined within the function's
scope or passed as arguments. This will lead to an error because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ There are no parameters defined for the function, which limits its reusability and flexibility.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are used to calculate the sum. This makes the function
more flexible and reusable.
* ✔️ The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`, providing the expected functionality.
* ✔️ Use case: `sum(5, 3)` will return `8`.
